Changes in version 0.9.1 -- 2005-12-04
------------------------
- tool m3u2link (create hard links from conent of .m3u file) added
  (located in directory tools)


Changes in version 0.9 -- 2005-12-03
----------------------
- after scanning the contents of jukeboxdir some data is stored in
  the file .moosicWebGUI-dump.dat (located in configdir). Upon startup the
  content of the dumped data is read. If the stored jukeboxdir and the
  current jukeboxdir match the initial scan of the jukeboxdir is omitted.
  This speeds up the program's start-up significantly when dealing with
  extraordinarily large jukeboxes.

- .moosicWebGUI-memo.m3u moved from jukebox dir to configdir
  (where it really belongs)

- online handbook started (roughly more than a skeleton currently):
  - .lyx source file added
  - links to online handbook and to manual page added to template

- man page improved

- link to wdg html validator (on local machine) added in debug mode,
  in order to use the validator the wdg-html-validator package
  (debian/ubuntu) needs to be installed


Changes in version 0.8.5 -- 2005-11-20
------------------------
- HTML improved:
  - validates correctly against W3C DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN
  - minor HTML quirks in genertated HTML fixed

- template reorganized, memo now has its own navigation box

- functions exit, clear, clearmemo and list no longer show their content
  in the message box but rather in the main box

- new function: re-scan of jukebox directory, template updated accordingly

- minor code clean-up: 0 / 1 changed to False / True where appropriate

- Forest's template replaced with improved version (fab-template.html)


Changes in version 0.8.4 -- 2005-11-04
------------------------
- minor bug introduced in version 0.8.3 fixed

- added template file fab-template.html (contributed by Forest Bond)


Changes in version 0.8.3 -- 2005-11-01
------------------------
- new option -i: ignore exit, exit requests via HTTP are ignored,
  the link to the exit function is created dynamically; template
  updated acordingly

- memo function implemented: current track is stored in a special
  memo playlist ($jukeboxdir/.moosicWebGUI-memo.m3u) upon request.
  New methods: memo, list_memo, clearmemo, clearmemo2: template
  updated acordingly

- new method list_pl: show content of playlist (.m3u) file

- minor code cleanup


Changes in version 0.8.2 -- 2005-10-30
------------------------
- all errors during scanning of options are now considered fatal,
  program terminates

- all warnings now go to sys.stderror


Changes in version 0.8.1 -- 2005-10-12
------------------------
- patch from Forest Bond implementing options -c, -n and -t included:
  -c: use alternate config file
  -n: add natwork spec to new ACL allowed_netorks
  -t: use alternate template file
  parsing of moosic option file for valid filename extensions

- support for .m3u files (file format for playlists) added, extension
  .moo is deprecated (simply rename existing .moo files to .m3u)

- .m3u filenames are scanned during startup and stored globally

- maximum number of displayed entries increased from 100 to 250
  as version 0.8 is much faster than previous versions


Changes in version 0.8 -- 2005-06-03
----------------------

- dramatic speed-up escpecially when dealing with large Jukeboxes
  (instead of += all content new content is appended to a list;
  after completion the list is joined). On my slowest machine (700 MHz)
  the time for the generation of the tree view of my Jukebox decreased
  from 15 sec to approx 0.5 sec (!) as reported by /usr/sbin/ab.

- fixed error in do_HEAD (wrong status codes)

- added support for favicon.ico, icon added
