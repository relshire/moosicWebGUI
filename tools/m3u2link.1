.TH "M3U2LINK" "1" "04 Dezember 2005" "" ""

.SH NAME
m3u2link \- create hard links from content of .m3u file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fBm3u2link\fR m3u-file targetdir
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBm3u2link\fR is a small utility to create hard links from the content
of a .m3u file. The content of the .m3u file is read and analyzed.  For
each absolute pathname found in the .m3u file and which points to an
existing regular file a hard link is created in the target directory.
The target directory is required to exist and to be empty before
executing \fBm3u2link\fR\&.
.PP
The links created in the target directory are named in accordance with
their respecive filename as stated in the .m3u file (with the pathname
stripped off) with the following modifications: preceding digits, spaces,
underscores and dashes are ignored and the filename is preceeded with
a serial 4-digit number and two dashes in order to preserve the .m3u
file's track ordering.
.TP
\fBExample\fR
\fB/path/to/69--some_artist--some_hit.mp3\fR will be linked to
\fBtargetdir/0000--some_artist--some_hit.mp3\fR (0000 indicates
that the file was the first absolute pathname found in the .m3u file
processed)
.PP
Upon successful completion \fBm3u2link\fR prints some statistics.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.TP
\fBcan't process <file>\fR
File <file> given in the .m3u file is not a regular file.
.TP
\fBcan't hard-link file <file> to <link>\fR
File <file> given in the .m3u file can not be linked to <link> in
the target directory.  Possible causes: the filesystem containing
the target directory does not support hard links, the permissions of
the target directory are not sufficient for the operation or <file>
is located on a different device as <link>\&.
.PP
All other messages should be self-explanatory.
.SH "CAVEATS"
.PP
The initial program version is rather simple and straight-forward.  The
target directory needs to exist, it is not being created.  In addition,
no provisions are made (deliberately) to remove any exisiting files
in the target directory.  Filenames specified in the .m3u file must
be specified by their absolute pathname (starting with "/" -- sorry
no MS-DOS compatiblity here).  URLs found in the .m3u file are silently
ignored as well.  Cross-links between devices are not possible, no attempts
are made to copy sourcefile(s) from other devices to the target directory.
